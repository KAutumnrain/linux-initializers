# Personal Linux starter scripts

These are pretty basic bash scripts for installing packages and 
making starter points for systen customization. My intent is to
expand these out further and have it for a selection of distros
based on package availability in those repositories.

## Future OSes/Distros that I use pretty often and want starter scripts for

- Arch
- Fedora
- Gentoo
- NixOS
- OpenBSD  

Check projects and `todo` for future plans on these
